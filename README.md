# What the fuck is this?

An express server written in nodejs to assist in a rather not-so-legal activity known as piracy, designed to work with my other chrome extensions which post required information for downloading series and movies from various streaming sites including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.

## Requirements

- Node.JS 15+ (You can probably get away with 12+ but I haven't tested it)
- Windows (developed against Windows, probably will work on Linux but haven't tried)
- FFMPEG
- Aria2c
- Bento4 (specifically mp4decrypt)
- Decryption keys for the content (don't ask me for help getting the keys)

### I'm not providing support for this or instructions for use, it's only here for educational purposes.
